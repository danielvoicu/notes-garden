# Hi there, welcome! ðŸŒ±

This is my digital garden, a small corner of the internet where I learn and share ideas. If you're new around here, starting with [[ TheIndex.md | The Index]] is a good idea â€” it's a bit like a map to all the stuff you'll find here.

The thing about this garden is, it's always changing. I update the content as I learn and grow, so you might find that a note you read today will be different tomorrow. Yep, that includes this one too.

This whole project is about learning in public. I'm excited to share what I know, and I'm hoping we can learn from each other along the way.

If you have thoughts, comments on what you find here, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.online/@danv) or you can [send me an email directly](contact@danielvoicu.dev).

Thanks for dropping by!
