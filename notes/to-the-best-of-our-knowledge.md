I think in May or June I found out about a great podcast called **[To the Best of Our Knowledge](https://www.ttbook.org/)**. I've been listening to it since then, and I remember that the first episode that I listened to is called "*Solace of Nature*". In that episode they talked about the way nature influences our life, how it can offer us contemplative experiences.


I continued with another episode called "*The Weird, Wild World of Mushrooms*". In this episode one of the guests was Paul Stamets, a mycologist on whom a character from "*Star Trek: Discovery*" was based on. The character even shares his name and has a similar job, but with a twist: he's an astromycologist. This episode was also a good starting point for me to check out a documentary on Curiosity Stream called "*[The Kingdom: How Fungi Made Our World](https://curiosity.tv/0ba3w75)*". You should check it out if you would to know more about the importance of fungi and their relationship with the environment, trees, plants and even humans.
