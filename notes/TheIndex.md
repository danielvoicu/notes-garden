### Welcome!

Hi, I'm Daniel. Thanks for dropping by my digital garden. This place is a space where I will post random notes about the things I find worth mentioning. These things might be books (and notes on them), movies (and notes on them), articles (and notes on them). See? A lot of things with notes on them.

### What I have in my digital garden

At this point, I only have a few notes. You can check them out either by using the backlinks below each article or through the list from this post.
