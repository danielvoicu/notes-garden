### Welcome!

Hi, I'm Daniel. Thanks for dropping by my digital garden. This place is a space where I will post random notes about the things I find worth mentioning. These things might be books (and notes on them), movies (and notes on them), articles (and notes on them). See? A lot of things with notes on them.

### What I have in my digital garden

At this point, I only have a few notes. You can check them out either by using the backlinks below each article or through the list from this post.

* [[note-taking-apps-second-brains-and-writing|Note taking apps, second brains and writing]]
* [[about-reading|About Reading]] - About reading and the barbell method.
* [[how-i-remember-the-90s|How I remember the 90s]] - Something about growing up in the 90s, in Romania.
* [[why-a-digital-garden|Why a digital garden]] - Why I started a digital garden.
* [[to-the-best-of-our-knowledge|To the best of our knowledge podcast]] - Note about "*To The Best of Our Knowledge*", a great podcast that covers a lot of subjects.
* [[ideo-podcast-on-the-future-of-food|IDEO Podcast on the future of food]] - "*Food by Design*", a podcast from IDEO. I will listen to it soon and update the note with some of the stuff I liked from it.
* [[rewriting-everything|Rewriting everything]] - A note about how we tend to rewrite everything, looking for the perfect version.

This list will be updated in time.[^1]
