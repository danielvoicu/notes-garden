## Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel. ðŸ‘‹

I have been working in advertising &amp; publishing as a copywriter, and starting from 2015 I have switched careers. Right now I work as a frontend developer, and Iâ€™m also interested in creative coding.

I maintain a creative coding community with 17k+ members, covering languages, frameworks and libraries such as Processing, P5.js, openFrameworks and d3.js.
