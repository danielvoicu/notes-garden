# Notes on Things - Digital Garden
A digital garden built using [11ty](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy).

This is based on the starter template created by [@binyamin](https://github.com/binyamin). You can find the original template here: [Eleventy Garden](https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden/).

## About
The original template included:
- Double-bracket links - as seen on Roam
- It also displayed backlinks
- Shows hovercards for backlinks

I've also added:
- RSS Feed
- Notes show the date on which they were last changed
- Styling changes
- Included article image in backlink preview

## License
This project is under the [MIT](https://github.com/danielvoicu/notes-garden/blob/main/LICENSE) license, just like the original template by [@binyamin](https://github.com/binyamin).
